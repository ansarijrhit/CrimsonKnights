a program to create a set of cards for the Cockatrice app of the Crimson Knights Card Game.

## Cockatrice Installation:
install Cockatrice at https://cockatrice.github.io/
select the version you need on the left sidebar and follow installation instructions.
When Cockatrice opens, downloading the MTG card database is optional. You may skip installing the card database by selecting 'Cancel' when oracle explorer opens and the select 'No' when it asks if you would like to update the database again.

## Loading custom cards into Cockatrice
To load the Crimson Knight cards into Cockatrice, you will need to download the file [CrimsonKnights.xml](https://github.com/ansarijrhit/CrimsonKnights/blob/main/CrimsonKnights.xml), and the [images folder](https://github.com/ansarijrhit/CrimsonKnights/tree/main/images).

Open Cockatrice and in the top bar open the **Card Database** dropdown menu and select **Add custom sets/cards**. This will open a file selector where you need to navigate to where you saved **CrimsonKnights.xml** and select it.

To load the images for each card, open the **Card Database** dropdown again and select **Open custom images folder**. This will open a folder where you will need to save all of the images from the **images folder**. Do not place the images in a subfolder in the **Custom Images Folder**.

If the sets were not automatically enabled, open the **Card Database** dropdown and select **Manage Sets**. If you downloaded the MTG card database, search for CKCG to filter only the crimson knights cards and manually select them to enable. Otherwise, you can just hit "enable all"

## Creating a Deck
To create a Custom Deck in Cockatrice, go to the **Deck** tab. This will be open by default if you are not connected to a server. Under the **Deck Editor** dropdown menu, either hit **New Deck** or **Load Deck**. This will fill the right side of the screen with the cards in the deck. You can then add cards to the deck by double clicking a card from the list on the left, or selecting a card already in the deck and hitting the green plus to add more. To remove a card from the deck, select it and hit the red minus. double clicking a card already in the deck will move it to the sideboard. The set name for each card is the character that card belongs to preceded by "CKCG:" (CKCG stands for Crimson Knights Card Game). The hero character card (the card with just the hero name) contains the characters HP, ATK/AC, and ability. this will need to be added to the deck so you can have it on the field during a game. 

## Connecting to a Cockatrice server
You can register to the Rooster Ranges server from within the app. It will require a username, password, and email for activation. server host name an port number can be found here https://www.cockatrice.us/

To register, open the **Cockatrice** dropdown menu in the app and enter the hostname **server.cockatrice.us**, port number **443**, enter login information, and hit ok. they will send an activation code to your email. once your account is activated, open the **Cockatrice** dropdown menu again and select **Connect**. Under **Known Hosts** select **Rooster Ranges**, enter your username and password, and hit connect. Congrats! you can now create online games and play remotely with your friends!

## Creating a game room
To create a room, first connect to a server. You will see several tabs open up below the top toolbar. Select **Magic**. Here you will see a list of rooms created in this server. Either select a room to join, or hit "Create" below the list of rooms. Add a description and password (to keep out those pesky MTG nerds), and select the number of player you want in the game. Than all you have to do is invite your buddies to join and select your decks. Have fun!

## Notes for being in a game
Once you start a game, remove the hero character card and all equipemnt from the deck (for Draveik, also remove either Sealed Dielong or Unsealed Dielong, since it has two forms) and place them on the side. to search the Deck, right click on it and select "View Library". Drag and drop the cards where you want to place them, and then right click the Deck and select "Shuffle Library". A good place to out your hero card is in the Red Zone, and a good place for your unequipped items is in the Exile spot (the bottom section on the left, below the graveyard and deck)
